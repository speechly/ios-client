# SpeechIntent

A speech intent.

``` swift
public struct SpeechIntent: Hashable
```

An intent is part of a phrase which defines the action of the phrase,
e.g. a phrase "book a restaurant and send an invitation to John" contains two intents,
"book" and "send an invitation".

Intents can and should be used to dispatch the action that the user wants to do in the app
(e.g. book a meeting, schedule a flight, reset the form).
